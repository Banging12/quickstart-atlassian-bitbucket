## Bitbucket Data Center on the AWS Cloud

Use this Quick Start to deploy Bitbucket Data Center on the AWS Cloud. Bitbucket Data Center is a Git repository management solution from Atlassian. It provides source code collaboration for enterprises that require high availability and performance at scale.

This Quick Start uses the [Atlassian Standard Infrastructure (ASI)](https://fwd.aws/xYyYy) as a foundation. You can choose to build a new ASI for your deployment or deploy Bitbucket into your existing ASI. You can also deploy Jira and Confluence Data Center within the same ASI.

For architectural details, best practices, step-by-step instructions, and customization options, see the 
[deployment guide](https://fwd.aws/dEX6W).

### Network prerequisites

You need to create the required AWS networking infrastructure
(VPC, subnets) by using the [ASI Quick Start](https://fwd.aws/xYyYy), or by deploying Bitbucket with a new ASI.
For details, see the [deployment guide](https://fwd.aws/dEX6W).
